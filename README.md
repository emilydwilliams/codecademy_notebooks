# codecademy_notebooks

In this repo, I've included some of the Jupyter Notebook projects I completed for Codecademy's Data Science career track curriculum. So far, this includes...
* Twitter K-Nearest Neighbors Binary Classifier (Will this tweet be viral or not viral?)
* Twitter Naive Bayes Multi-class Classifier (Which country is this tweet from?)
* Masculinity Survey K-Means Classifier (What groups can we form based on survey responses?)
* Capstone Project (Given an OKCupid profile, can I predict a user's age? Can I predict whether or not the user has children?)
